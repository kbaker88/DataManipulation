Hamiltonian cycle(tour) - A path which visits every vertex exactly once.

NP - nondeterministic polynomial time - a problem that can be verified
in polynomial time but unknown to be solvable in polynomial time. 
P - polynomial time

asymptotic - line that approaches a curve or value but never touches.
degenerate tree - parent nodes only have one child node, creating a 
				  structure more similar to a linked list. 

pigeonhole principle (birthday problem)

Concepts: 
	- Memory Stack:
		Stores static variables in RAM. Each thread gets its own Stack.
		The size of a stack is static (note stack overflows).

	- Memory Heap:
		Stores dynamic variables in RAM. All threads share one Heap. Size
		of a heap is dynamic. Heaps can suffer from memory fragmentation.

	- Logical Memory Address:

	- Physical Memory Address:

	- Memory Paging:
		Done by the Memory Management Unit(MMU) part of the CPU. Paging
		splits RAM into equal size chunks.

Data Structures:
	- Hash Table:
		An array of buckets which uses a hash function to insert
		elements. Ideally each insertion will get it's own index
		in the array.
		* Load Faction is entries / buckets
		* Collision resolution with open adressing or separate chaining

	- Binary Tree:
		K-ary tree with k = 2. Each node can only have at most two
		children. Doesn't necessarily have a labeling function to
		give the nodes values.

	- Binary Search Tree:
		Binary Tree with the property that a node's key must be
		greater than or equal to it's left child and less than
		or equal to it's right child.

	- Huffman Encoding (Tree):
		Binary tree with the left child denoting a 0 and right
		child denoting a 1 for a binary code to retrieve a
		leaf of the tree. The more weight a leaf has, the
		fewer levels from the tree it is located.

Algorithms:
	- Strassen's Algorithm: 
		For Matrix multiplication ~O(n^2.84)
		* Only practical for matrices with dimensions over 1,000
		* Coppersmith-Winograd algorithm is faster for matrices 
		  too large for modern computers
	
	- Humffman Encoding:
		Add a weight value to every member of an alphabet. Combine
		the two lowest weighted members of the alphabet with their
		combined weights creating the key to their new root node.
		Continue combining until one tree is remaining containing
		the entire alphabet

	- Asymetric numerical systems
		Encoding algorithm

	- Dijkstra's:
		Shortest Path algorithm

	- A*:
		Pathfinding algorithm
